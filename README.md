# piscine_c
This repository contains all the work I have done along the C piscine at School 42 on July 2019 in Paris.
Also included, all the subjects (in french) and resources needed to get ready for this trial.
I have left the main folder for testing purpose.
Warning : everything is not guaranteed Moulinette proof. Check the grades below to estimate how credencial the code is.
This work if far from beeing flawless. But it was mine at this time, and it got me accepted in 42.
